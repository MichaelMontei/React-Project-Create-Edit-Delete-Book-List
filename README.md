## The Mission (First Part)

Make a book Application where a client can:
- add a book 
- edit the titles of the books
- delete the books entirely of the page.

## The Mission (Second Part)

In the second part we will make use of: 
- Local Json Server setup (refreshing the page will not delete our books from the page anymore)
- File called db.json to store data 
- POST request to create a book 
- PUT request to edit a book 
- DELETE request to delete a book.

## Steps of creating this APP

- Create all components ((BookCreate, BookList, BookEdit and BookShow)
- Make a nice layout for the page
- Make a request to an external API to get some random pictures for the books.

## Solution

In this project I wanted to make a Book List where a customer can add books, edit titles of books and delete books. 
I used several components (BookCreate, BookList, BookEdit and BookShow) which you can find in my projects folder.
